## Code Validation

### HTML Validation

W3C Markup Validation is a service offered by W3C, which enables you to assess the compliance of your HTML code with the official standards. This service identifies syntax errors, improper tag usage, and other issues that might impact the structure and meaning of your web pages. By utilizing W3C Markup Validation, you can ensure that your HTML code is well-structured and conforms to established web standards.

Google Chrome web browser and the 'Inspect' function were used to capture the HTML page from the webb applications templates, which was then validated against the W3C Validator.

Two error codes were ignored during the validation process as they are inherent to the Vue framework and do not affect the functionality of the application:

- `Start tag seen without seeing a doctype first. Expected <!DOCTYPE html>`
- `The type attribute for the style element is not needed and should be omitted. (10)`

### CSS Validation

[W3C Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) is a tool provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows you to validate and check the correctness of your HTML and CSS code. It helps ensure that your web pages comply with the standards set by the W3C, promoting interoperability and accessibility.

| main.css   | No errors or warnings | <details><summary>Screenshot of result</summary>![Result](docs/testing.md/test-stylesheet-main.JPG)</details> |    âœ…    |

### JAVASCRIPT Validation

[JSHint](https://jshint.com/) is a robust JavaScript code analysis tool that aids in improving the quality and reliability of your JavaScript code. It serves as a linter, helping you catch potential errors, enforce coding conventions, and enhance the overall maintainability of your code.
Taking full JS files from the project folder, but also JavaScript snippets in different Components.vue files where there is JavaScript code for validation of the JS code. Below, you can find the file path along with errors and passes.

Below you can see the errors that was showing on one script of userStore.js that was embedded with import from the .env file for secret key. Besides from this error, all javascript was passing without any errors. I was passing /* jshint esversion: 11 */ as comment on all js files before validating them.

- `import.meta may only be used in module code.`

## Accessibility

### **Wave**

[The WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to assess the accessibility of the website. WAVE helps identify potential accessibility issues and provides guidance on how to improve the accessibility of web content.

During the evaluation, the following issues were identified:

- **Errors**: Six errors were found related to missing labels for inputs. These were immediately addressed, and there are now no errors in the application. All input elements have corresponding labels, ensuring better accessibility for users.

- **Contrast Warning**: Five warnings were noted due to insufficient contrast between white text and the green background on buttons. Although this color scheme does not meet the recommended contrast ratio standards, we have opted to retain it for aesthetic reasons. However, improving the background color contrast remains a potential future enhancement to further boost the application's accessibility and usability.

By using the WAVE tool, I gained valuable insights into the accessibility of my website. While I have chosen not to address certain errors at this time, I remain committed to creating an inclusive user experience and will continue to explore ways to improve accessibility in the future.

## Performance

I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of [The Reminder To Do website](https://next.com/) using [Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/). This evaluation was performed in Google Chrome browser's incognito mode to eliminate all potential impacts from other addons and cached files.

The performance scores were assessed for both desktop and mobile devices. Below are the summarized results:

### Desktop Performance

- Average performance score: 100 / 100
- The majority of pages received score 100 / 100, indicating excellent performance.
