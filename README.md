# Methodology

The Reminder To Do project follows a methodology inspired by AGILE principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution.

### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects

To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### Individual Task Management with Trello

To manage daily tasks efficiently, Trello, a desktop application, complements GitHub Projects. For instance, when assigned a user story with multiple tasks, these tasks are imported into Trello for detailed management. Linnk to Trello can be found [here](https://www.trello.com/)

### User Stories as GitHub Issues

Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Iterative Development Approach

The Reminder To Do project adheres to an iterative development approach, facilitating continuous enhancements within a predefined timeline. Despite its condensed schedule, the project accommodates future iterations and expansions.

To ensure efficient prioritization, our project employs the MuSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) method. User stories critical to the app's success are categorized as Must-haves, followed by Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves. You can refer to our [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/KimBergstroem/projects/12) to view the prioritization.

Within each sprint, a MoSCoW method is used to further prioritize user stories. They are classified as Must Do, Should Do, Could Do, and Won't Do, representing the remaining user stories that will not be included in the sprints. This approach ensures a clear differentiation between our overall project prioritization and the prioritization within each sprint, minimizing any potential confusion.

**Labels and User Story Distribution (MoSCoW):**

- **Must-Have:** 6/11
- **Should-Have:** 3/11
- **Could-Have:** 1/11
- **Wont-Have:** 1/11
- **Task:** 4
- **Documentation:** 4

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development

Bugs uncovered during development are documented as GitHub issues, offering insights into each bug's characteristics, impact, and reproduction steps. By hyperlinking these issues in README.md, users can stay updated on bug resolutions and contribute insights.

### Future Backlog and Progress

The project board efficiently manages user stories, with the "Not started" column representing upcoming iterations. This backlog previews user stories set for subsequent development phases.

Emphasizing that the project timeline is expedited, the iterative approach maintains adaptability, enabling ongoing refinements and improvements aligned with evolving user needs.

# **Database**

The Reminder To Do application utilizes Supabase for its backend infrastructure, particularly for user authentication and data management. Supabase offers a comprehensive solution that significantly simplifies the development process by providing ready-made authentication mechanisms and database functionalities. This choice allows the project to focus more on core functionalities and user experience enhancements rather than spending time on building and managing custom database tables and authentication systems. By leveraging Supabase, the application benefits from robust security, seamless scalability, and efficient data handling, ensuring a reliable foundation for user interaction and data management.

</p>

# **Design**

### **Colour Scheme**

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/readme.md/readme-colorpalette.png" />
</p>

**Dominant (50%):**

Our dominant color, which constitutes 50% of our color palette, is a deep and sophisticated shade of dark gray (#1A1A1A). It forms the primary background of our application, providing a visually appealing canvas that enhances readability and user focus. This dark gray tone creates a modern and elegant atmosphere, ensuring a comfortable viewing experience even during extended use.

**Secondary (30%):**

The secondary color, occupying 30% of our color palette, is a slightly lighter shade of gray (#242424). This color is used for content areas and provides contrast against the dominant background while maintaining a cohesive and harmonious dark theme. It serves as an effective backdrop for text and images, offering clarity and readability across various sections of the application.

**Accent (10%):**

Our accent color, comprising 10% of our color palette, features a refreshing shade of teal (#008C76). This accent color is strategically applied to interactive elements such as buttons and links, adding vibrancy and visual interest to key features and calls to action. Its distinctive hue stands out against the darker background tones, guiding user interactions and enhancing the overall user experience.

### **Typography**

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

- **Cinzel** was selected for headings and larger text elements across the site. It boasts elegant serif letterforms, lending a touch of sophistication to the design.

![Cinzel](image)

- **Roboto** serves as the primary typeface for body text, including paragraphs containing questions and answers. Developed by Christian Robertson, Roboto is a versatile sans-serif font known for its clean, modern appearance and excellent legibility.

### **Imagery**

All the images were modified by me in Photoshop or Canva.

&nbsp;

### **Wireframes**

A very basic wireframe was created using the [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/) web application. This wireframe serves as a preliminary design blueprint, offering a simplified visual representation of the project's layout and structure. Given the project's relatively small scale, the wireframe provides a clear and concise overview without delving into intricate design details.

The primary focus of this project is on functionality and responsiveness. The wireframe aids in outlining the essential elements and their placement, ensuring a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation. By emphasizing core functionalities and responsive design, the project aims to deliver an efficient and accessible user experience across various devices.

# **Features**

### **Accessibility**

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

- Using semantic HTML elements as, header(), section(), nav().
- Declare the Language in the beginning of every html page.
- Using descriptive ALT attributes on images and links on the site.
- Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button or not.
- Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
